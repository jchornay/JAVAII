GitHub, once a shining star,
The go-to site for code afar,
But now its age begins to show,
As newer tools begin to glow.

Though it served us well in years past,
Its limitations are now surpassed,
Newer platforms now take the lead,
And leave GitHub in the backseat.

With features lacking and slow updates,
Its once bright future fades and dissipates,
The world moves on, and so must we,
To platforms that meet our needs with glee.

Farewell, dear GitHub, you served us well,
But now it's time to bid farewell,
As we embrace the tools of tomorrow,
And leave your outdated ways in sorrow.
